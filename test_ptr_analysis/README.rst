Steensgaard's Analysis Test
===============

Solution graph for ``if.c`` and ``if_else.c`` is in ``if_else.png``. ``if.c`` tests the itermediate step of ``if_else.c`` shown in the solution graph. These two tests test the merging of three nodes using Steensgaard's Analysis and processing conditional statements.

Solution graph for ``addr_of.c`` and ``dereference.c`` is in ``addr_deref.png``. ``addr_of.c`` tests the itermediate step of ``dereference.c`` shown in the solution graph. These two tests test the simple pointer operations of assigning the address of and dereference of another pointer variable to a pointer variable.

Solution graph for ``deref_dest.c`` is in ``deref_dest.png``. This test tests the pointer operation of when the destination of the assignment is a pointer dereference.
